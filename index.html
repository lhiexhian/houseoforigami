                <h1>Welcome to House of Origami!</h1>
                <p>Origami comes from the Japanese words ori, meaning "folding", and kami, meaning "paper." It is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese cdivture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their cdivture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat, square sheet of paper into a finished scdivpture by applying folding and scdivpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs that use cuts.</p>

                        <p>The basic origami folds can be combined in various ways to create intricate designs. The best-known origami model is the Japanese paper crane. In general, these designs begin with a square sheet of paper whose sides may be of different colors, prints, or patterns. Traditional Japanese origami, which has been practiced since the Edo period (1603–1867), has often been less strict about these conventions, sometimes cutting the paper or using nonsquare shapes to start with. The principles of origami are also used in stents, packaging, and other engineering applications.</p>
